# Publisher Info
Apart from config element, Publisher sampler has Gzip compression feature

# Subscriber Info
The subscriber works perfectly. The current mechanism of Subscriber is 
* The config elements creates a local queue to store the messages received from the GCP.
* Currently, the Queue size is hardcoded to 100K 
* The Subscriber sampler is bound to read it form the queue, which is already subscribed by the Message receiver(which is a separate client library's thread)
* The subscriber sampler is reading and removing the message from the queue. In the future, will change the ack to be done by the sampler.
* When the subscriber sampler is triggered and If there is no messages in the queue, It will wait until a new message arrive to process it.
* each message retrieved from the subscriber will have the message ID and publish time info along with the message.
* The message ID and publish time info will be returned in response headers and message on response body
* The subscriber sampler supports De-Compression, If the message is in gzip compressed format.
* Supports multiple topic subscription feature in the same test plan
